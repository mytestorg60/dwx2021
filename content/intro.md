# August 6, 1991 the first website ever went live

The site was dedicated to information on the World Wide Web project and was made by Tim Berners-Lee.

The first web page address was [http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)

It outlined how to create Web pages and explained more about hypertext.

No doubt the journey of the WWW started with static content first.
